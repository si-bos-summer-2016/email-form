Send mail via GMAIL with this contact form package. This contact form is intentionally designed to be ugly. If you end up downloading this, please contribute by adding some type of styling, feature, or anything else you can think of to make it look pretty, or more secure for users. 

You can download the zip and play around with your styling changes before you make the changes to the files in the repo.

There are some specific issues I know about, and plan to add to the errors section here. Feel free to jump on them and fix them. Also, feel free to post errors of your own.
